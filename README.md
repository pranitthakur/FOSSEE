# FOSSEE

NOTE:-all the impulse response taken in my function are of the H(z)=(a0+a1*z+a2*z^2.......am*z^m)/(b0+b1*z+b2*z^2.......bm*z^m)
not in form of z^-1 as done in matlab.
                                                                       
To run these function ,inputs can inputted by us before running  the program just keep in mind the form of impulse response H(z),I have chosen.
